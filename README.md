# Wordscape!!!!

A Wordle-inspired word game but this one means everything to me fr.

This is a **historic project**. Not just another JavaScript game, but the final project I built before diving into **React JS**.

It carries the sweat and tears (no actual tears were shed lol), but it does hold a special place in my programming journey. 
I had this project idea all the way back when I was just starting out with JavaScript. To finally bring it to life feels incredibly **accomplishing**.

> I love JavaScript so, so much â€” it's made me smile even on the bad days.

This project isnâ€™t just a technical milestone, it's an emotional one too. Iâ€™m **really really happy** to finally wrap this up â€” proud and excited for what comes next.
